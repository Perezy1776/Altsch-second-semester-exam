    <title>Welcome to Peredubafa Landing Page</title>

<h2>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>This project focuses on the development of a simple, static website using HTML syntax only. The website consists of a single  page describing this work and a little biograpy about the work owner,  all designed to provide essential information in a clean and structured format.

Once the website is built, it is deployed on a Linux server using Apache2, a popular open-source web server software. The deployment process involves configuring the Apache2 server, transferring the website files to the appropriate directory, and ensuring the server is correctly set up to serve the website to users via a web browser.

This project demonstrates the basics of website creation and hosting, highlighting skills in web design using HTML as well as server management and deployment using Apache2 on a Linux platform.</p>

<h2>A SIMPLE BIOGRAPY ABOUT MYSELF</h2>


<p>My name is Peredubafa Osunu, a passionate web developer with a love for creating clean and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p> I have a flare for problem-solving, and I enjoy  the challenge of turning complex ideas into functional digital experiences.</p>

<p>  Outside of tech, I love travelling, though i have been to only one African country but has travelled to over 15 states of Nigeria, including the Abuja, the Federal Capital Terrory.</p>

 <p>  When I am  not behind a computer screen, I can be found reading some audio books or listening inspiring teachings from renowned Christian leaders.</p>

 <p> As a man from the Southern part of Nigeria, I love to swim as part of exercising my muscles for better fitness</p>
